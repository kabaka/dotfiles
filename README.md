# Home Directory

I tend to customize things just enough to do what I need. Lots of what I use
(especially things such as `.vimrc`) are largely copy/pasted from references.

You may or may not find these useful. Some of them will depend on specific
installations or configuration data not shown here. Sorry. This README will be
just as useless for now.
