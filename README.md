# Dotfiles

My configuration files!

Included are most `~/.*` files and directories.

I will be updating this README file with information about these files, screen
shots of the more interesting things, and whatever else seems relevant.

## vim

For my .vimrc and related files, see [my vimrc repository](/kabaka/vimrc).
